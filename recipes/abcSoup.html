    <h2> Description </h2></li>

    ABC soup is a nourishing soup cooked with potatoes,
    carrots, tomatoes, onions and pork ribs/bones or chicken.

    It could also be easily turned into a vegetarian soup 
    by omitting the meat.

    Super simple to make.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    Serves: 4 servings.

    <ul>
        <li>1 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 yellow onions</li>
        <li>1 carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 corn</li>
        <li>2 chicken drumstick(s)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 l water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>

    If you have a slow cooker, definitely use one.

    <ol>
        <li> Score the skin of the tomato and potato. 
            Put them into a pot of boiling water. 
            After one minute, put them into a bowl of cold water. 
            This will "shock" them and the skin would then be easily removed. 
            Otherwise, using a spoon would help too. </li>

        <li> Cut all vegetables into chunks or slices, according to your preference. 
            Optionally, remove the skin of the drumstick.</li>

        <li> Put all ingredients into a pot of boiling water. 
            Then, let it simmer at low heat for 2-3 hours or 
            for a minimum of 1.5 hours. 
            Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>

    </ol>
