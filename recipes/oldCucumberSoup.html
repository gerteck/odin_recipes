    <h2> Description </h2></li>

    Old Cucumber Soup is a damn nice slow cooked Cantonese soup, where the 
    cucumber turns really soft and has a creamy texture to it.
    The health benefits of 'lau huang gua tang' as known to the Chinese community 
    are abundant. Contains high dietary fiber, iron, calcium and is said to even have
    anti-aging properties. 

    Super simple to make.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    Serves: 4 servings.

    <ul>
        <li>250g pork bones</li>
        <li>6g ginger</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
        <li>8 scallops (dried)</li>
        <li>1 old cucumber</li>
        <li>3 oysters (dried)</li>
        <li>4 red dates</li>
        <li>2l water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon goji berries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>

    If you have a slow cooker, definitely use one. It is reccomended to boil the
    soup over 6-8 hours on low heat to allow the igredients to slowly release
    their nutrients.

        <li> Bring a pot of water to boil. Add ginger and pork bones. 
            Allow water to boil again before removing the bones. </li>

        <li> Add water, old cucumber (seeds removed), 
            red dates (seeds removed), goji berries, dried scallops and 
            dried oysters into a clean pot. Bring to boil. Then, reduce 
            heat to the minimum and let it simmer for at least 1.5 hours 
            before serving.</li>
